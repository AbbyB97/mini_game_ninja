Hi , this is a basic platformer game that I made with godot engine.
It has all the basic elements of a platformer game you can import it in godot engine and add your further changes as per your vision.

-I have added mobile controls as well if you dont want that you can comment the code from src/menus/JoystickButton.gd from line 26 to 56.
Happy game jamming !!
